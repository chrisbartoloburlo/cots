### Generating the test drivers
There are two options for using SeTTS.

#### Option 1: Local configuration
Download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). This will be used to send requests to the SeTTS service (online) in order to generate the test drivers. 

#### Option 2: Online configuration (preferred)
You will only need to follow the instructions at <link>. 

### Executing the test drivers
To execute the test drivers, you will need to:
1. Download and install a [Java SE Development Kit (recommended: version 11 LTS)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).
2. Download and install [sbt v1.5.0](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).



<!-- Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

```bash
bundle install
```

Run the following to generate your site:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
